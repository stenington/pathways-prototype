Badge Pathways prototype

## Quick Start

You will need [meteor][] and [meteorite][].

[meteor]: http://docs.meteor.com/
[meteorite]: http://oortcloud.github.io/meteorite/

```
git clone https://github.com/stenington/pathways-prototype.git
cd pathways
mrt install
meteor
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/. Log in with

* an email address for which you have a [Backpack][] with public groups, or
* the `DEMO_OWNER` address listed in `server/demo.js` (default: `demo@stenington.org`)

[Backpack]: https://backpack.openbadges.org

## Project

This code is not under active development at the moment. The code is in more
or less the same state as it was during MozFest 2013 where this prototype was
demonstrated. 

However feel free to fork it, expand on it, and play around.

For news about upcoming work on badge pathways, keep an eye on the [Open Badges Google group][group],
and look over the agendas of our weekly community calls.
